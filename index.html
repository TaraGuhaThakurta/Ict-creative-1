                <h3>Why is Learning About AI Important for Kids?</h3>
                <p>AI is all around us, and whether or not you realize it, people use artificial intelligence every single day.

                    Even though AI is used today, computer scientists predict artificial intelligence will be even more prominent in the future.
                    
                    Because of this, many jobs will also need us to understand how AI works so we can solve big problems.
                    
                    This is already true of many professions today.
                    
                    Doctors use AI to diagnose patients based on medical scans, like X-rays.
                    Astronauts can use AI models to detect exoplanets, or planets outside our Solar System.

                <h3>This is MIT's opinion on the topic</h3>

                    A student recaps how he would describe artificial intelligence to a friend: 
                    “It's kind of like a baby or a human brain because it has to learn,” 
                    he says in a video, “and it stores [...] and uses that information to figure things out.”
